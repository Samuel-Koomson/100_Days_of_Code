On this day, my task is to produce a character guessing game that determines who is more popular from a list of dictionary
The two people or selected items are generated randomely by the system. 
One the player gets the answer right, the answer is compared with another randomely generates item until the player guesses wrongly.
The game ends the moment the player guesses wrongly and his score is displayed.
