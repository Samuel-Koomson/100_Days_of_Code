Today's lesson creates a hangman game, using a word guessing approach
For every letter in the word that we get wrong, we put our hangman in danger.
Eventually the hangman dies if we get the word wrong or win if we get the word right.

For this project, we will make use of the following concepts in programing

1. For and While loops
2. If/Else conditions
3. Lists
4. Strings
5. Range
6. Modules
